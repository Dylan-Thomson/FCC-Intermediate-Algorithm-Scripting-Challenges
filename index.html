<p>Output is done via console.log in the developer console (try hitting F12)</p>
<p>Please feel free to test the functions on your own by calling them in the console!</p>
<dl>
	<dt>sumAll([a, b])</dt>
	<dd>Take array of two numbers. Return sum of those two numbers and all numbers between them.</dd>
	<dt>diffArray(arr1, arr2)</dt>
	<dd>Take two arrays, return the symmetric difference of the two arrays. In other words, return an array of items that appear in one of the
arrays but not both.</dd>
	<dt>convertToRoman(num)</dt>
	<dd>Take a number, return its Roman Numeral.</dd>
	<dt>whatIsInAName(collection, source)</dt>
	<dd>Look through an array of objects (collection), returns an array of all objects that have matching property value pairs (source).</dd>
	<dt>myReplace(str, before, after)</dt>
	<dd>Perform a search and replace on the sentence using the arguments provided and return the new sentence.</dd>
	<dt>translatePigLatin(str)</dt>
	<dd>Takes the first consonant (or consonant cluster) of an English word, moves it to the end of the word and suffixes an "ay". If a word begins with a vowel you just add "way" to the end.</dd>
	<dt>pairElement(str)</dt>
	<dd>The DNA strand is missing the pairing element. Take each character, get its pair, and return the results as a 2d array. Base pairs are a pair of AT and CG. </dd>
	<dt>fearNotLetter(str)</dt>
	<dd>Find the missing letter in the passed letter range and return it. If all letters are present in the range, return undefined.</dd>
	<dt>booWho(bool)</dt>
	<dd>Check if a value is classified as a boolean primitive. Return true or false.</dd>
	<dt>uniteUnique(arr)</dt>
	<dd>Write a function that takes two or more arrays and returns a new array of unique values in the order of the original provided arrays. In other words, all values present from all arrays should be included in their original order, but with no duplicates in the final array.</dd>
	<dt>convertHTML(str)</dt>
	<dd>Convert the characters &amp;, <, >, " (double quote), and ' (apostrophe), in a string to their corresponding HTML entities.</dd>
	<dt>spinalCase(str)</dt>
	<dd>Convert a string to spinal case. Spinal case is all-lowercase-words-joined-by-dashes.</dd>
	<dt>sumFibs(num)</dt>
	<dd>Given a positive integer num, return the sum of all odd Fibonacci numbers that are less than or equal to num.</dd>
	<dt>sumPrimes(num)</dt>
	<dd>Sum all the prime numbers up to and including the provided number.</dd>
	<dt>smallestCommons(arr)</dt>
	<dd>Find the smallest common multiple of the provided parameters that can be evenly divided by both, as well as by all sequential numbers in the range between these parameters.</dd>
	<dt>findElement(arr, func)</dt>
	<dd>Create a function that looks through an array (first argument) and returns the first element in the array that passes a truth test (second argument).</dd>
	<dt>dropElements(arr, func)</dt>
	<dd>Drop the elements of an array (first argument), starting from the front, until the predicate (second argument) returns true.</dd>
